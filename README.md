# Holberton smiling school

In this project, you will implement 3 web pages with Bootstrap. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.

## Requeriments
- We will have to use Bootstrap
- Our styles.css must be as small as we can - we must use as much as we can Bootstrap classes
- Responsive design

## Final result
